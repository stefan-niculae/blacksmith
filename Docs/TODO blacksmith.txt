Rename database from DefaultConnection to Blacksmith

Make user only have username and password

	modify login
	modify navbar to show username field, not email

Make col-*-offset-* work in submitted links (center them horizontally)

if there is a timeout for updating the db, don't let the user leave the page

validators for submitted links (length, trimming, regex for websites & whitespace/newlines)

undo functionality for links (update pending -> cancel update and updated -> undo update)

only allow unique website links (this includes an ajax call to retrieve the already existing names!)

fix footer (not to overlap when there enough content)

refresh favicon & address on the inserting link	

when esc is pressed while editing a [contenteditable], restore to original and cancel pending upadte

center .action-wrapper (without the width: 18% workaround!)

?when clicking a contenteditable, make it as big as the line permits (not just as big as the text)

move submitted links & link adding to the user page

also offset to the right change pw and logout

make the database connection string go through the web.config variable in search.aspx, not be hardcoded
